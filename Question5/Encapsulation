Java provides three keywords in order to define the scope and the access permissions of a class member or method: public,
private and protected. A public member or method can be accessed from any other class. A private member or method is accessible
only within its own class. Finally, a protected member is accessible within its class, its sub-classes and in all classes that
reside in the same package.

Example codes:

public class Dice {
        /** The no of dice. */
	private int noOfDice;

	/** The min. */
	int min =1;
	
	/** The max. */
	int max=6;

	/** The random. */
	private Random random = new Random();

	/**
	 * Instantiates a new dice.
	 */
	public Dice() {
	}

	/**
	 * Instantiates a new dice.
	 *
	 * @param noOfDice the no of dice
	 */
	public Dice(int noOfDice) {
		super();
		this.noOfDice = noOfDice;
	}

	/**
	 * Gets the no of dice.
	 *
	 * @return the no of dice
	 */
	public int getNoOfDice() {
		return noOfDice;
	}

	/**
	 * Sets the no of dice.
	 *
	 * @param noOfDice the new no of dice
	 */
	public void setNoOfDice(int noOfDice) {
		this.noOfDice = noOfDice;
	}


	/**
	 * Throw.
	 *
	 * @return the int
	 */
	public int Throw(){
		max = (max*getNoOfDice());
		return random.nextInt(max-min+1)+min;
	}
