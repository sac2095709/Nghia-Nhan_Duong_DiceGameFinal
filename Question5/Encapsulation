Java provides three keywords in order to define the scope and the access permissions of a class member or method: public,
private and protected. A public member or method can be accessed from any other class. A private member or method is accessible
only within its own class. Finally, a protected member is accessible within its class, its sub-classes and in all classes that
reside in the same package.

Example codes:

public class Dice {
private int numOfThrows;
    
    public Dice()
    {
        numOfThrows = 0;
    }
    
    public int getNumOfThrows()
    {
        return numOfThrows;
    }
    
    public void addToThrows()
    {
        numOfThrows++;
    }
    
    public void playGame()
    {
    }
}
